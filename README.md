# EMODnet traits and text mining

In this repo we store some notes, resources and code as we study the feasibility
of an text mining tool for marine species traits. 

The basic componets for this study are

* corpus containing relavant literature
* curation/annotation system to help train models
* dictionary/vocabulary containing traits, their synonyms and definitions
* tagger, to retrieve the terms from the corpus
