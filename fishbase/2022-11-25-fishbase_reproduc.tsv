Reproduction occurs only when temperatures are over 20°C. Several yearly spawnings every 30 days. Females incubate eggs inside their mouths (approximately for a week) where larvae hatch and remain until the vitellus is reabsorved. Egg size 1.5 mm, larval length at hatching 4 mm.
Spawns in firm sand in water from 0.6 to 2 m deep of lakes (Ref. 2) and inshore waters (Ref. 55624). Males set up and defend territory which are visited by the females. Courtship lasts several hours.  A single male probably fertilises the eggs of more than one female (Ref. 55624). Eggs are shed in batches in shallow nest and fertilized by male. Each batch of eggs is picked up into oral cavity by female. Females solely involved in broodcare. Female carries up to 200 eggs in her mouth where the larvae hatch and remain until after the yolk-sac is absorbed."	NA

Displays a lek mating system; territorial males establish breeding territories where they dig spawning pits, assume a dark coloration, defend a breeding territory and actively court females; sneaking males intrude into nests during a spawning episode, exhibiting quivering behavior which is usually an indicator of sperm release; sneaking is predominantly performed by subordinate males, which may adopt pseudo-female behavior (Ref. 57425). Only territorial males produce sounds, during all phases of courtship but especially during the late stages, including spawning (Ref. 49830). Territorial male excavates and defends a basin-shaped pit in the center of his territory, where female deposits 100-1700(1800) eggs (Ref. 44894, 52307). Eggs and milt are sucked up by the female (Ref. 2, 44894). Fertilization is reported to sometimes occur in the mouth of the female (Ref. 6028). Females incubate eggs alone (Ref. 12501, 52307). It is possible, albeit rare, that males take up some eggs after spawning (Ref. 2, 5726, 52307, 57895), but they almost always eat them soon after (Ref. 52307). Females school together while mouthbrooding (Ref. 40035), they cease to feed and subsist on food reserves stored in their body (Ref. 1). Females may spawn a full clutch with just one male, or may spawn with several different males in a series (Ref. 52307). Water is circulated over the eggs by chewing movements of the jaws (Ref. 12501, 12522). Fry hatch in the female's mouth after 3-5 days (Ref. 2, 12501, 12522, 44894, 52307), depending on the temperature (Ref. 52307). The young are released from the mouth in 10-14 days, but remain near the female and enter the mouth if threatened until about 3 weeks old (Ref. 2, 44894, 52307). Fry and juveniles shoal in shallow water (Ref. 6465, 7248, 57895) where they feed during the day, and retreat to deep water at night (Ref. 87, 6465). Females raise multiple broods during a season (Ref. 7248, 57895).	NA

Herring populations are known to use traditional spawning grounds, many of which are along shallow coastal areas (15-40 m depth) or on offshore banks down to 200 m (Refs. 6684, 89572). Spawning usually occurs on gravel or rock bottoms, with the exception of Baltic populations which show a preference for shallow (less than 10 m depth) seaweed beds (Refs. 89520, 89572). Each population spawns only once a year over a relatively short time period (Ref. 89573). At least one population is spawning in any one month of the year, each having a different spawning time and place. The herring is a demersal spawner that releases a ribbon of sticky eggs that sink to the sea bed (Ref. 89574) and adhere to the substrate. The eggs released by a spawning population may be several layers thick which may deprive eggs in the bottom layers of oxygen, causing egg mortality (Ref. 89563). Although higher fecundities were reported earlier (e.g. Ref. 74523), fecundity now ranges from 10,000-60,000 eggs (Ref. 89571). Hatching may take up to 3 weeks, depending on temperature (Ref. 89571). Larvae are pelagic and drift with the current. Note: it is impossible to summarize briefly the wide range of spawning strategies of Atlantic herring; the best reviews are those of Svetovidov (Refs. 4608, 4609) for the Eastern Atlantic Ocean and Hildebrand (Ref. 4607) for the Western Atlantic Ocean.

Spawning sites are in offshore waters, at or near the bottom, in 50-200 m depth and 0-12 °C (preferred range 0-6°C) (Refs. 1371, 89387). May form spawning aggregations in the water column when bottom temperatures are unsuitable (Ref. 1371). Different spawning areas may be used in subsequent years (Ref. 89387). Embryo development lasts about 14 days (at 6°C) and larval phase lasts about 3 months(at 8°C). Fecundity ranges from 2.5 million eggs in a 5 kg female to a record of 9 million eggs in a 34 kg female. Reported number of batches spawned in an experiment is 8 - 22 (Ref. 5513). Sex ratio is nearly 50%, with slight predominance of females. Classified as a determinate multiple spawner (Ref. 40290). Older and larger cod had been found to produce larger eggs with neutral buoyancy at lower salinities. This can be crucial to egg and larval survival (Refs. 31930, 38384). Larvae are pelagic up to 2.5 months before settling on the bottom (Ref. 1371).
In the Baltic, spawning cumulates in March at depths below 20 m near the bottom. The nursery areas are in the inner coastal zone. Recruitment to the fished stock starts below 2 years and peaks at about 3 years of age (Ref. 5947)."	NA

Over a study period of 5 years, courtship-like behaviour was observed off southwest England between May and July, always in surface waters along thermal fronts; because actual mating was not observed, this may occur in deeper water (Ref. 88831). A one-year resting period between pregnancies is thought to occur, resulting in a 2-4 year interval between litters (Ref. 9030, 1765, 88829).

They ascend rivers in April and May when water temperature is 9-12 °C, peaking at 13-16 °C. Adults may migrate up to 700 km from the sea into major rivers and occasionally into the largest tributaries of these rivers to spawn (Ref. 10536). Males migrate upriver at 3-9 years; females first reproduce 1-3 years later than males. Gametogenesis occurs during spawning migration. 
Males arrive first in the upper reaches and occupy appropriate spawning sites, with females arriving 1-2 weeks later (Ref. 10536). Spawning sites are usually shallow areas (<1.5 m depth) of rivers near a confluence  with strong currents and clean gravel bottoms (Refs. 188, 10536, 59043). Spawning occurs at night (over several nights), in large and very noisy schools that form near the surface.when water temperature reaches at least 15 °C and is believed to be optimal between 22-24 °C. (Ref. 88171). Coupling happens side by side, thrashing caudal fins on water surface and swimming in circles while expulsing eggs and sperms in the surrounding water. Eggs are fertilized in mid-water and then sink to the gravel bottom. Eggs hatch after 4-8 days (22-24 °C) (Ref. 89630). After spawning, adults return to the sea but many die before reaching it (Ref. 188, 51442, 59043). Only 5-6 % of the adults spawn more than once in their lifetime (Ref. 89655). After 3-4 months juveniles (8-12 cm length) move towards the sea until mature (Ref. 10536). Individual fish apparently return to their natal spawning site (Ref. 59043). Also Refs. 5744, 5745.

Females larger than 205 cm fork length are estimated to have a mean fecundity of 30-60 and 13-15 million eggs, in the western and eastern Atlantic respectively (Ref. 40805, Ref. 88871). Spawning occurs when sea surface temperatures are between 22.6-27.5 ºC and 22.5-25.5 ºC in the Gulf of Mexico and Mediterranean Sea respectively (88868). Spawning occurs between June and August in the Mediterranean Sea (Ref. 88868). Eggs are released directly to the water column and hatch after 2 days (Ref. 88823). At 24°C, embryo development lasts about 32 hours and larval stages about 30 days. Egg size 1.0 mm, larval length at hatching 2.8 mm.
Spawning grounds are mainly known from the Gulf of Mexico and the Mediterranean Sea, but the presence of mature individuals and larvae far from these areas (e.g. Bahamas and central North Atlantic Ocean) suggest that other spawning grounds may also be utilized (Ref. 88873, Ref. 88874, Ref. 88872). Appears to display homing behaviour with (western-tagged individuals migrating back to specific spawning sites either in the Gulf of Mexico or the Mediterranean Sea) (Ref. 88872, Ref. 88870). Fidelity to natal areas seem to occur once individuals reach maturity, i.e. after returning to either the western or eastern spawning grounds (Ref. 88868).

Lacustrine populations move to tributaries (Ref. 59043). Spawning migration into freshwater lasts from June to November. Spawns at 6-10°C (Ref. 89464) in gravel river areas far upstream with moderate to fast-flowing, well-oxygenated waters and a succession of riffles and pools (Refs. 6390, 59043). The female selects a site where the gravel is of the right size and of sufficient depth (0.1 to 0.3 m) (Refs. 7471, 51442) and water depth is around 0.5-3 m (Ref. 35387). The female digs a depression (""redd"") by turning on her side and flexing her body up and down, without touching the stones (Ref. 36794). This species spawns in pairs. The male guards and defends the female against other males (Ref. 59043). A female releases between 8,000-25,000 eggs during a spawning season (Ref. 7471, 88187); 500 to 2000 per kg (Ref. 51442). Fertilized eggs sink into the redd and are covered with a layer of gravel (0.1-0.3 m) usually by the male (Refs. 7471, 59043). Females are also observed to cover the eggs. Individual spawning is completed in 2-3 days (Ref. 7471) after a female digging several redds and spawning with several males. Period of spawning lasts for 1-2 weeks. Most males die after spawning, while 10-40% of females may survive and return to the sea in autumn or overwinter in rivers, feed one summer, and migrate again. They may spawn in the year following the first reproduction or may remain at sea for 18 months before returning once more to the river. Of the returning females, about 0.3-6 % spawn a second time and very few spawn a third or fourth time. In short rivers with presumably less exhaustive upstream migration, up to 34% of returning individuals spawn a second time; some individuals may spawn for up to six seasons (Ref. 59043). Eggs hatch in spring, usually after 70-160 days (Ref. 59043). Upon hatching, alevins (i.e. newly-hatched young up to 1 month) are negatively phototactic and move deeper into the gravel (Refs. 58137, 59043). As their yolk sac is absorbed, the fry emerge from the bottom and move to shallow riffles just downstream of their redd (Ref. 59043). Mortality of young individuals during the first months may range from 14-61 % (Ref. 89465). Parr (i.e. juveniles) may remain in freshwater environments for 1-7 years (depending on temperature and feeding conditions) but most stay for 2-3 years. Parr undergo morphological and physiological changes called smoltification which prepares them for life in the sea. At the southern end of their range, many reach a length of 12-15 cm, transform into smolts and are ready for migration in spring of the first year after hatching (Refs. 7471, 51442). At the northern end of the range they may take 5-6 years to reach smolt stage (Ref. 36794). Smolts move towards estuaries, the continental shelf and eventually the open ocean (Ref. 89462). The Atlantic salmon matures between 3-7 years (Ref. 41851). After 1-4 years at sea, it migrates back to the upper reaches of its natal river to spawn (Refs. 59043, 89461). It has an acute sense of smell and it is suggested that it imprints a sequence of odours while inhabiting rivers and during its smolt run. It presumably reverses this sequence to return to its natal site (Ref. 89461). Several studies have shown that smolt runs are strongly correlated to increasing water temperature and water flow during spring (Ref. 89461).
There is little evidence of natural spawning by land-locked populations of Atlantic salmon in Australia, and populations are maintained by stocking (Ref. 6390, 26519)."	NA

After hatching at 12 mm, larval brown trout remain in the gravel for 2-3 weeks until they are about 25 mm long, when they emerge to begin feeding in the water column. Brown trout are territorial and begin establishing territories as juveniles. Juvenile trout from lake populations move from their natal inlets to lakes during the first 2 years of life (Ref. 6390).

Males mature generally at 2 years and females at 3.  Spawning happens from November until May in the Northern hemisphere and from August to November on the Southern hemisphere.  The size of the eggs depends on the size of the female.  In captivity spawning is fostered by abdominal massage.  Egg size 3-6 mm,  fry length after hatching 12-20 mm. Hatchlings are well developed and equipped with a large yolk sac.      
The female finds a spot and digs a pit.  While digging, an attendant male courts her or is busy driving away other males.  As soon as the pit is completed, the female drops into it and is immediately followed by the male.  The pair is side by side, they open their mouth, quiver and release egg and sperm.  Females produce from 700 to 4,000 eggs per spawning event (Ref. 4706).  At this point, a subordinate male moves in and releases sperm into the nest.  The female quickly moves to the upstream edge of the nest and starts digging a new pit, covering the eggs.  The whole process is repeated for several days until the female deposits all her eggs (Ref. 27547).  Young fish move downstream at night, shortly after emergence (Ref. 4706).

Male develop a humpback, an enlarged head and large teeth on both jaws that form a pronounced hooked type (Ref. 59043).  The upstream run seems to be triggered by high water (Ref. 27547).  Female builds the redd by lying on one side and using its tail, it displaces silt and light gravel to produce a deep trough.  Male spends most of the time driving off intruding males. When the redd is completed, the female drops into it, followed immediately by the male. They open their mouths, vibrate and release eggs and sperm. In some cases, several males spawn with a single female. The eggs are then covered as the female digs a new redd at the upstream edge of the previous one. Adults live up to a few weeks after spawning before they die (Ref. 1998, 27547).  Reported to die 10-20 days after spawning (Ref. 59043). About 1200-1800 eggs are laid.

Spawning occurs at depths of ~3 meters, current speeds of ~20cm/sec. near the head waters over sand and pebbles at 4-11° C water temperature. At spawning time the female excavates a hole of around 1 meter diameter and 50 cm depth before spawning can occur (Ref. 12218). Nest building is done by the female by lying on one side and lashing its tail to displace the sand and silt on the river bed. The pair then settles in the nest, mouths gape, and with rapid vibration of the pair, eggs and milt are released. The female then covers the nest. Males are aggressive and may spawn with different females; females likewise may spawn with other males and therefore builds different nests. Adults die after a week (Ref. 1998). A fish spawns 700-7,000 eggs in two to three egg releases. Eggs are ~300-3,500 per spawn. Egg size is ~6.7 mm,  water temp. is 8-10°C at 60 days before hatching.  Larva size is around 16 mm. Come springtime the juveniles go to the ocean and come back 3-4 years later to their exact birthplace. This fish reaches maturity in 2-4 years. Larvae are found around the spawning site, Juveniles are found around the coast. Juveniles migrate to the ocean at ~27-45 mm during February at water temperatures around 4° C (Ref. 12218).

This occurs during summer and fall and as late as December in the southern part of the range. The female selects a site, usually with gravel bottom, and digs a nest. During nest building, the female is attended by a dominant male and a few subordinate males. At this stage, females tend to be aggressive toward other females and subordinate males; males are aggressive toward other males. Between digging acts, the female will rest over the pit while the dominant male courts her. Once the nest is completed, the female enters the nest, followed immediately by the dominant male who comes close beside her. Their mouths gape, and the pair vibrates to release eggs and sperm. One or more subordinate males may come to the other side of the female and join in the spawning. The female then moves to the upstream edge of the nest and digs again, covering the old nest, at the same time creating a new one just upstream from the previous one. A female normally needs 3 to 5 days to deposit all her eggs and utilizes 3 to 5 nests for this purpose. She may spawn with several dominant males. A male may breed with several females.

The female is attended by a larger, dominant male and several smaller males who drive away other males. While the female digs the nest, the male courts her by coming to rest beside her and quivering; by swimming about over her, touching her dorsal fin with his body and fins; and occasionally nudging her side gently with his snout (Ref. 28978). Upon completion of the nest, the female drops into it and is immediately joined by the dominant male. The fish open their mouths, vibrate, and eggs and sperm are released.

Spawning takes place at almost any time of the day. A female invades a males territory and finds a suitable spot for a redd. Once a spot has been selected, she starts digging. While the female is digging, the male courts her by circling around her and then gliding along her side and quivering. When the redd is completed, the pair release egg and sperm. The pair then swim forward out of the nest, often still ejecting sex products. This may be repeated up to 5 times before the female begins to cover the eggs. The female then digs at the edge of the pit, covering the eggs and beginning the next redd (Ref. 27547).

Males reach spawning beds first and spend some time cleaning the rocks. Females arrive a few days later and are courted by the males. During and following courtship, the males attempt to spawn with the females. One or two males approach a female, press against her sides and quiver.

Generally, spawning occurs during the day. The sexes pair and a larger female is usually attended by one or two smaller males. They swim through and over the vegetation in water usually less than 17.8 cm, releasing eggs and sperm simultaneously at irregular intervals (Ref. 1998).  Eggs are deposited in flooded areas and on submerged vegetation over a period of 2-5 days (Ref. 59043).  Only 5 to 60 eggs ae released at a time (Ref. 27547). This act is repeated every few minutes for up to several hours, after which the fish rest for some time before resuming.

Maturing male barramundi migrate downstream from freshwater habitats at the start of the wet (monsoon) season to spawn with resident females in estuaries (Ref. 27132) and on tidal flats outside the mouths of rivers (Ref. 6390).
Barramundi spawn on the full moon and new moon, primarily at the beginning of an incoming tide which carries the eggs into the estuary (Ref. 28135).
Barramundi are broadcast spawners that aggregate to spawn (Ref. 6390). Spawning aggregations occur in or around the mouths of rivers (Ref. 28132). While adults and juveniles are capable of living in fresh water, brackish waters are required for embryonic development (Ref. 6136). Female barramundi are capable of producing large numbers of eggs, with estimates as high as 2.3 million eggs per kg of body weight (Ref. 28134).
Barramundi are protandrous hermaphrodites, i.e., they undergo sex reversion during their life cycle. Females are generally absent in the smaller length classes, but dominate larger length classes. Most barramundi mature first as males and function as males for one or more spawning seasons before undergoing sex inversion. A few females will develop directly from immature fish (Ref. 28132). Similarly, some males may never undergo sex inversion (Ref. 28132).  Also Ref. 103751."	NA

One or two of these males chases a ripe female as soon as it arrives in the area (polyandry) (Ref. 6258). The queue of males maybe longer composed of about 15 to 25 individuals, but only two prod their snouts against the female's belly (Ref. 205). After rounds of curved course through the interlacing branches near the surface (Ref. 205), males fertilize the egg ribbon as the female lays them over weeds or other submerged objects (Ref. 6258).  Eggs grouped in long white ribbons (up to 1 m) are found over submerged objects (Ref. 41678).  Eggs hatch in about 8 to 16 days at normal temperatures (Ref. 6258).
Males mature at 2-3 years and females at 4 years. Spawning, in the Northern hemisphere, happens in spring in waters with temperatures between 7-8°C. Eggs are laid in sticky strings becoming fixed to
aquatic plants and rocks. Incubation lasts about 1- 8 days at 1- 3°. Egg size 2.0-2.5mm, larval length at hatching 5mm."	NA

Spawn in pairs, at dawn or night.  The female remains over the nest while the male circles rapidly around, at about 1 meter from the nest. Then male takes a vertical orientation and both swim around swiftly, and eggs and sperm are released, The female leaves the nest after all eggs are released. The male defends the nest and fans the eggs with his pectorals. Females spawn once a year, laying all the eggs at one time (Ref. 88075).

Reproduction starts after 3-5 years of age, when 25-30cm size is reached. Spawning happens  mainly during the months of February-May (for example, off the coasts of Galicia), although in warmer areas
(such as the Mediterranean), it can occur at the beginning of the winter. Incubation lasts about 5 days (at 1 2°) and larval phase 35 days (at 18°C).

Distinct pairing with embrace (Ref. 205). Courtship starts when the male chases the female, then when both are ready, they drop to the bottom (Ref. 43278). During courtship and prior to copulation, the male bites and wraps its body to the female pectoral fin, body, tail, and gills (Ref. 51127, 49562). The male then inserts a single clasper in the female's cloaca; copulation lasts 30 to 40 min. After one or two weeks later, the eggs are laid in about 11 to 14 intervals for 4 months which were deposited under rocks or in crevices, as was observed in nature. In captivity, the female drops the eggs on the bottom where the contents of the egg cases maybe eaten by these sharks; the eggs are hatched in 7 to 9 months. The young begin to feed one month after hatching (Ref. 43278).	NA

Distinct pairing with embrace (Ref. 205).  Eggs leave the ovaries, and while in transit in the oviducts are fertilized and enclosed in groups of 16 to 23 in egg cases. However, at some time between fertilization and birth only two (Ref. 5578, 6586) embryos of its group prevails, possibly by devouring its rivals, and proceeds to eat fertilized eggs and smaller potential siblings in utero until birth. According to Springer (1948) (Ref. 39565), it is evident that this species sends forth into the world not only large, well-developed, and even experienced young but may send them forth with a full stomach. The yolk sac is resorbed at a small size, less than 17 cm, and the umbilical scar may be lost. Gestation period may be from 8 to 9 months long. Size at birth 100 cm (Ref. 6586).
Pratt (2001) (Ref. 49562) relates Gordon's (1993) (Ref. 51113) detailed account of the mating behavior of the sand tiger sharks as follows: ""mating activities began when the two male <i>C. taurus</i>, having become reluctant to feed, increased their swimming speed, accompanied by clasper flexion and eventual interest in their female tank mates...aggressive displays such as snapping and stalking became frequent, mostly toward species of smaller <i>Carcharhinus</i> in the tank. The males did not become interested in the female until she slowed, moved to the sand area and started cupping her pelvic fins. The two males then became competitive toward each other, circling and tailing, until the alpha male forced the beta male out of the sand area. The female bit the male prior to copulation. She exhibited shielding behavior for several days and then resumed cupping and flaring. The female gradually changed her swimming position and began displaying the submissive behavior. The alpha male swam in increasingly larger circles and began splaying its claspers, then approached the female and exhibited tailing and nosing. Copulation occurred as the male bit into the right flank and trailing edge of the pectoral fin of the female. The male swam side by side with the female, copulating with the right clasper for one to two minutes. After copulation, the male showed little interest in the female."" In captivity, males show aggression toward other species after copulation (Ref. 51113, 49562). Females avoid patrolling males by 'shielding' with pelvics close to the substrate (Ref. 51113, 49562). However, female acceptance of future male partner is indicated by a show of 'submissive' body, 'cupping' and 'flaring' of pelvic fins (Ref. 51113, 49562)."	NA

Embryos feed solely on yolk (Ref. 50449). The egg cases are anchored to macroalgae, sea grass or sessile erect invertebrates such as poriferans, bryozoans and hydroids (Ref. 32804, 58137). The capsules have tendrils at each corner used for anchorage purposes. Egg capsule size varies according to locality and female size (Ref. 244) and ranges between 4.9-7.0 cm length and 1.5-3.0 cm width (Ref. 88837). Egg cases may be deposited throughout the year, peaking in June and July (Ref. 32804). Recent studies estimate fecundity of females from the northeast Atlantic to be at around 29-62 pups (Ref. 32804). Fully formed pups hatch after 5-11 months, depending on water temperature (Ref. 244, 32804). Newly hatched pups are about 8-10 cm in length (Ref. 78469).

Nuzzling is done about 1-1.5 hours before spawning. For most of the day the fish swam slowly in school. At nearly spawning time, one or two males approach a selected female and begin pecking and pushing her swollen  abdomen with their snouts. Interruption happens at this stage resulting in spawners returning to the school. With less than an hour until spawning, 2-6 males may attempt to get their abdomen as close to the female's abdomen as possible. For the pair that completes this position, a spiraling ascent to the surface occurs followed by a release of both eggs and sperm while other males come in pursuit. These sneakers release sperm at the same spot where the initial pair had released their gametes. Some spawnings may occur without sneakers getting involved in the process (Ref. 37498)."	NA

Spawning on surface substrate (e.g. flotsam) when present is the usual reproductive mode but other modes may be employed if this substrate is not available. The fertilised eggs may remain suspended in the water surface during its development with the help of the small filaments on the egg surface and the adhesive filaments holding the egg mass together, by increasing the surface to volume ratio of the eggs, which aids in propping the eggs up in the water column. The eggs may also be suspended upon current or become benthic."	NA

During most of the observation period, a single pair swam slowly in a side-to-side orientation at a height of 25 to 75 cm above the reef. No conspicuous courtship displays were evident, nor was there any evidence of sexual identity, i.e.,  the female was not obviously swollen with eggs. Shortly after sunset, the pair ascended in a broad, shallow arc off the bottom, traversing approximately 7 to 10 m while ascending to a height of 2 to 3 m. As the pair ascended, each angled its body slightly, with their venters in close proximity, if not actually touching. This position was held throughout the peak of the arc, with the pair diverging on the descent. Other pairs in the area were seen making similar arcing movements elsewhere on the reef at approximately the same time. It was difficult to see if there were gametes released in the event. There was no interference between pairs during spawning.  Monogamous mating is observed as both obligate and social (Ref. 52884).	NA

From the work of Libby and Gilbert (1960) (Ref. 51117) and Luer and Gilbert (1985) (Ref. 38742) male and female clearnose skates mate side by side in an upright position (Ref. 49562). Actual copulation occurs when the male bites the caudal margin of the female's pectoral, bends his tail 75 degrees beneath hers and inserts one clasper, flexed ('splayed') medially 90 degrees, into her oviduct (Ref. 49562). A female displays 'back arching' and 'pectoral fin undulations' as precopulatory behavior to attract males (Ref. 49562)."	NA

Males establish territory and dig a spawning pit (Ref. 2, 6465, 54601), using mouth and fins (Ref. 2), up to 60cm deep and 4-6m in diameter; a number of territories can often be found clustered together (Ref. 52307).  Territories are defended by means of agressive behaviour (Ref. 6465), including lateral display, lateral biting and mouth-to-mouth combat (Ref. 2).  Reproduction is stimulated by long photoperiods and inhibited by short daylengths (Ref. 54365).  Reproduction requires a minimum temperature of about 20°C (Ref. 2).  Males visit schools of females and attempt to attract a female spawning partner (Ref. 2, 52307).  Courting behaviour in the nest consists of lateral display by both sexes with nipping and tail-flapping (Ref. 2).  Eggs are deposited in single clutches, from several dozen to 100 eggs (Ref. 52307), and are taken into the females mouth as soon as they are fertilized (Ref. 2, 6465, 52307),  with a peak spawning frequency around the 9-11th hour of light (Ref. 31140, 54365).  One female may hold up to 2000 eggs in her mouth (Ref. 2).  The female swims away to deeper water with the brood after spawning is complete (Ref. 2, 52307), while the male renews spawning activities with another female.  Hatching occurs about 3 days after oviposition (Ref. 2).  Incubation time varies with temperature, 13-14 days at 25-27°C (Ref. 2, 52307) or 8-10 days at 29°C (Ref. 144), and juveniles leave the mother's mouth when they are about 1.1cm in length (Ref. 54601).  The young school near parent's head for a few days, reentering the mouth at any sign of danger or at a gesture of the female;  parent-offspring relationship ceases after 5 days (Ref. 2).	NA

The reproductive season lasts from September to March in the southern regions of the species distribution (Ref. 52307). Males construct (Ref. 2, 13337) and defend (Ref. 2) a nest in shallowish waters (Ref. 2, 13337), which is a central volcano-shaped mound (Ref. 2, 314, 364, 5214, 13337, 55074) with a flat or slightly concave top which is the mating platform, surrounded by a ditch and vallum (groove and boundary wall) (Ref. 2). The cone is higher than the boundary wall of the territory (Ref. 2). Spawns in waters up to 150 (Ref. 2) or 300 (Ref. 52307) cm deep, along banks of the lakes/river (Ref. 2). Males court several females in succession and females may mate with more than one male in a summer, so that large populations of young may build up (Ref. 5214, 52307).  Several nests are often grouped into an arena (Ref. 5214, 7248, 36094, 52193). If a male can successfully attract a female to his pit, both fish will swim to the center of the nest; the female then deposits her eggs - about 10-50 per spawn - and the male, possessing tassel-like genital papilla approximately 25 mm in length, swims over the eggs; the female touches the male's tassels with her lips, stimulating him to fertilize the eggs; surely part of the sperm will fertilize the eggs in the female's mouth, but the majority of the fertilization takes place outside, in the crater of the nest; Wickler (1966) wrote that he observed a spermatophore-like structure in this species but Trewavas (1983) wrote that it was more likely a filament of the genital papilla, as she did not observe any spermatophores in this species under natural conditions; pair-bonding does not take place, as partners are only together during spawning; in the wlld, females have been observed spawning with one male and then seeking others out to continue spawning with, in the end brooding some eggs from each; depending on its size, a female can carry up to 1300 eggs in her mouth; eggs have a diameter of 3 mm and are greenish-brown in color; a female can raise multiple broods per season, at about 5·week intervals; brooding females prefer to hide in regions with thick vegetation and cover; fry may initially leave the mother's mouth even before yolk sack is totally absorbed, but remain close together and are reincubated by the mother at night or when threatened; after about 21 days, the babies (about
20 mm long) leave their mother; they spend their earliest days in the shallow waters near the banks, or in other regions that contain plenty of shelter; once they increase in size, they will begin to venture out into more open water (Ref. 52307)."	NA

Rarely more than one brood in a season (Ref. 87, 246), but known to breed at least twice a year under pond conditions (Ref. 12524, 13337).  Males excavate saucer-shaped nests (Ref. 246, 314, 6465, 12524, 13337, 54048) that can be up to 75cm in diameter and 30cm deep, using mouth and fins (Ref. 2, 314, 52307), in the center of their territory (Ref. 52307), on a sandy substrate (any vegetation is uprooted with its mouth) and in water from 1-3m deep, where they display to attract females (Ref. 12524, 13337, 54048).  Up to 40 nests can be found together (Ref. 6465).  Females are the primary care-givers (Ref. 52307), moutbrooding eggs, larvae and fry; multiple broods are raised during the warmer months (Ref. 7248, 52193).  She lays her eggs in the concavity on top of the nest, the male fertilizes the eggs whereupon the female takes the eggs into her mouth where they are incubated; males guard the nest and females against all intruders; parental care is exercised for the first few weeks after the eggs hatch (Ref. 12524, 13337).

Males construct and maintain a mating platform which is a circular area of fine sand (Ref. 2), usually only about 10-15cm in diameter which is much smaller than the length of the fish (Ref. 55077), surrounded by a low ridge, on the top of a mound about 10 cm high (Ref. 2), but the mound might be 1m in diameter at its base and 30cm high (Ref. 55074, 55077). The plaque of sand is kept very clean, making the nest visible from a considerable distance (Ref. 55077). Little boundary fighting between close neighbours, but males seen to drive away individuals of other species (e.g. <i>Labeo</i> and <i>Clarias</i> as well as other cichlids)(Ref. 2, 55077). Females are seen in the nests at various times throughout the day; the number of times a male spawns appears to be limited by the number of ripe females available; females cruise over the spawning grounds singly or in small shoals (Ref. 55077). Courtship behaviour short and not particularly complex (Ref. 364), including displaying by the male to attract a female, snout shaking (nose wagging) and tassel dragging (Ref. 364, 55077). Female lays a batch of eggs and immediately picks them up while the male drags his tassel over the nest (Ref. 2, 55077), but it remains unclear whether the eggs are fertilised in the water or in the mouth of the female (Ref. 55077). Two, 3 or more batches of eggs may be laid by the same female before she leaves the nest (Ref. 2, 55077), and the larger the female the more numerous the eggs (Ref. 55077). Normal spawning generally takes less than 5 minutes (Ref. 55077). Breeding individuals spend little time feeding (Ref. 2), and males do not leave their territory to feed (Ref. 5507). Young of 11 mm still with large yolk sacs were the largest seen from the mouth of a female (Ref. 55077). Young of 2-6cm remain in schools in the shallows (Ref. 2, 55077).	NA

Gestation period lasts about 5 weeks and size at birth is 1.7- 3.5 cm (Refs. 58137, 88187, 89330). Aquarium experiments have shown that new born young are benthic, remaining close to the bottom Ref. 89330).	NA

Gonochorism is inferred for this species as sizes of males and females overlapped and male gonad morphology is typical of secondarily derived testes (Ref. 103751). Recent study classified juvenile hermaphroditism for this species wherein transition from ovary to testis occurs before ovarian maturation, hence, no true sex-reversal is observed (Ref. 107020).
In the aquarium, pursuit of a female with a slightly swollen abdomen by a male signifies the start of mating. The male uses its mouth to bump and push the female's abdomen. Then eggs and sperm are released at the water surface (Ref. 58706)."	NA

Spawning takes place during the rainy season in flooded deltas.  The fishes make a lateral migration towards the inundated plains to breed and return to the river or lake soon afterwards while the juveniles remain in the inundated area.  Juveniles return to the lake or river when they are between 1.5 and 2.5 cm long (Ref. 34291).  First sexual maturity occurs when females are between 40-45 cm and males between 35-40 cm. Eggs are greenish. Incubations lasts little (about 33 hours at 25°C).	NA

Females congregate in schools that may number hundreds of individuals (Ref. 2, 2781, 5595).  The male genital tassel, which develops together with the breeding dress and imitates a clutch of eggs, is dragged through the nest after the females has deposited some eggs, which are picked up immediately; the female probably mistakes the tassel for eggs that have been forgotten and tries to collect them as well, which results in the eggs being fertilized (Ref. 5595).  Females carrying eggs in the mouth move into open, more eutrophic waters, and stay there until the young have almost lost the yolk sac; they feed little during this time (Ref. 2781).  Females brood eggs/young, guarding their fry until about 52(-58)mm (Ref. 2, 2781).  Females move inshore with their young for at least part of the day; the young are spat out to feed, and food (small phytoplankton) is found in the foregut before the involuted yolk-sac is fully absorbed (Ref. 2781).

The eggs are enormous (9 cm in diameter and over 325 g in weight), and the huge yolk supplies all of the nutrients necessary for the growth of the embryo.  In 1975, a large female coelacanth in the American Museum of Natural History was found to contain 5 young in individual compartments of the oviduct (uterus).  They ranged in length from 301 to 327 mm and had well-developed teeth, fins and scales.  Each fetus had a large, flaccid yolk sac attached to its chest.  Dr Peter Forey of The Natural History Museum in London recently dissected one of these fetuses and found a 2 mm wide duct that leads directly from the yolk sac into the anterior part of the intestine.  This yolk duct serves to move yolk from the yolk sac into the intestine where it is digested by the fetus.  The same type of yolk transport into the gut via the yolk duct occurs in pups of ovoviviparous sharks. In some recent publications (Balon et al., 1988; Wourms et al., 1988; Bruton, 1989; Balon, 1991; Wourms et al., 1991) it was suggested (or even stated as a fact) that the reproduction of Latimeria involves ""oophagy"" or ""embryonic cannibalism"" (i.e., that the unborn pups feed on eggs or other siblings while in the uterus).  According to Heemstra and Compagno (1989), there was no evidence to support this ""oophagy"" hypothesis, and Dr Forey's examination of a pup (from the original litter of 5 in the American Museum) found that its intestine was full of yolk (which is what one would expect with a direct connection between yolk sac and intestine) and contained ""no trace of muscle fibres or anything else that might suggest that it had eaten a sib"". Despite the misgivings of Heemstra and Compagno (1989), Wourms et al. (1991) again suggested that ""Oophagy, the ingestion of supernumerary eggs by developing young, may well be the major source of supplemental nutrients for coelacanth pups.""  Speculating from a female that contained 19 ovulated eggs, they calculated that ""19 embryos would occupy 7.0 meters of uterine space in a 2.0 meter fish"" [the implication being that this is physically impossible].  They then concluded that ""At the very most, such a fish could accommodate seven or eight developing embryos, and 11 or 12 eggs would then be superfluous-eggs ... [which] serve as nutrients for the embryos that survive to term"".  Then, in August 1991 a large pregnant female coelacanth, 179 cm long and weighing 98 kg, was caught by a trawler off Pebane on the northern coast of Mozambique (Bruton et al., 1992).  This specimen was given to the natural history museum in Maputo, where it was dissected by the Director, Dr Augusto Cabral, who found that it contained 26 near-term pups, 31-36 cm in length.  Thanks to the discovery and preservation of this Mozambique female, we now know that it is indeed possible for a coelacanth to have at least 26 pups in a litter, and the ""superfluous-eggs"" hypothesis of ""oophagy"" for the coelacanth is itself superfluous. Two pups from the Mozambique specimen were dissected by Heemstra and Greenwood (1992) and found to contain an internal yolk sac, which is the remnant of the large external yolk sac seen on the younger pups from the American Museum specimen.  In the later stages of development, as the yolk supply dwindles, the external yolk sac apparently shrinks and is withdrawn into the body cavity.  Some of the Mozambique pups had a small external yolk sac, and in others there was only a flat scar along the ventral midline to show where the yolk sac had been. In view of the large size (31-36 cm) and advanced development of the pups from the Mozambique female, the size at birth for Latimeria is probably about 35-38 cm (Ref. 38228). Juveniles are born after 13 months (Refs. 26162, 38222) or 3 years (Ref. 30865) of gestation period. Thus, females may give birth only every second or every third year."	NA

Spawning occurs between March and August, when water temperature rises above 20 °C at depths of 2-10 m over stony bottoms in areas with strong current (1.5-2.0 m/s) (Ref. 51442, 59043, 89103).
Mature individuals do not feed during spawning migration (Ref. 3193). Number of spawned eggs increases with age. After spawning adults return to the sea (Ref. 51442). The development of the sticky dark grey eggs (2.6-3.0 mm diameter) takes about one week at 17°C (Ref. 26160, 35388). 
It is suggested that males spawn every 2 years, females every 3-4 years (Ref. 89072). Upstream spawning migrations appear to be positively correlated with water levels in rivers and distances of 1,000 kilometres or more may be covered when water levels are high (Ref. 89104). 
Sturgeons in general have a high capacity for hybridization and most species are able to cross-breed (Ref. 89103, 89117). This species has been reported to cross-breed (albeit rarely) with the Danube sturgeon (<i>Acipenser gueldenstaedti</i>) (Ref. 89105).

Just before breeding, males become very territorial. The male builds a nest of plant-material glued together with spiggin, a protein produced in the kidney (Ref. 52349). Once a nest is built, the male entices the female into the nest by performing a courtship dance which is a series of  zigzag movements (Ref. 1998). A receptive female follows the male who points the opening of the nest by posing above it with his head down. The female enters the nest, deposits up to a few hundred eggs, and is driven out by the male after eggs have been deposited. The male then enters the nest to fertilize the eggs. The male can choose to court another female to enter the nest and lay eggs before entering himself to fertilise the deposited eggs. Females may lay eggs in several nests over a period of several days or may be courted by the same male (Ref. 27547). The male guards and ventilates the eggs and young (Ref. 1998).  During spawning season, males develop a bright orange to red belly and blue-green flank and eyes.  Eggs hatch in 7-8 days.  Anadromous forms usually die of exhaustion after spawning cycle.  Freshwater individuals are able to complete several cycles within one year or sometimes over several years (Ref. 59043).	NA

The male uses his sucker to attach himself to the head of the female. The pair arch their bodies and the male wraps himself around the female. Both of the lampreys vibrate rapidly and eggs and sperm are extruded into the nest. Two males may simultaneously mate with a single female. A female will mate several times before her egg supply is exhausted, usually with several males. Ammocoetes spend one to two years in this stage.

In the spawning act, the female attaches herself to a rock and the male fastens its sucker on the head of the female and coils around the female. The two then vibrate and eggs and sperms are released (Ref. 27547). Males spawn with more than one female in different nests (Ref. 1998). Adults die 1-14 days after spawning (Ref. 1998), while other sources say adults die 3-36 days after spawning (Ref. 89241). Larvae remain buried in the stream bottom for up to 5 or 6 years and return to the sea after changing into the adult form (Ref. 1998). The parasitic adults spend 12-20 months in the sea before moving upstream to spawn (Ref. 1998).	NA

Behavioural experiments suggest that mature sea lampreys can smell the presence of ammocoetes and use this as a guide to functional spawning grounds (Ref. 88714). Spawning occurs in fast-flowing highly oxygenated areas with gravel, pebbles and sand bottoms (Ref. 12324). Females release small eggs (< 1 mm diameter) in nests exclusively built by males, which have been observed to reach the spawning grounds first (Ref. 5504, 12324, 51442). Spawning takes place mostly during sunny days, when water temperature is at least 15°C (Ref. 88171). Ammocoetes hatch after 7-14 days (41851, 88186). Successful hatching requires water temperatures of 15-25°C (Ref. 88715). Ammocoetes develop in freshwater and migrate to the sea after metamorphosis (Ref. 5504).  Also Ref. 30578, 51442.	NA

Development of young in the uterus being sustained by a large supply of yolk. Females give birth in late spring and summer in waters off Florida. During courtship, a pair sometimes a triplet of adults engaged in synchronized parallel swimming. While on it, the male may grab one of the female's pectoral fins with his mouth which induces the female to pivot 90° and roll on her back on the bottom. Then the male inserts a clasper in her vent, and then roll on his back beside the female. Pair may break apart and depart rapidly after copulation or the male may remain motionless on the subtrate as if recovering from the mating bout (Ref. 49562). Not all attempts of males to copulate with a female nurse shark result in successful fertilization, females may employ avoidance by 'pivotting and rolling' to escape from male attention (Ref. 49562). Or females may 'lie on back' and rest motionless and rigidly on the substrate (Ref. 51113, 49562). On the contrary, females send signals of readiness to copulate with males by arching their body toward their male partner and cupping the pelvic fin (Ref. 51126, 49562). Male nurse sharks may mate with many females over several weeks (polygyny) and vice versa (polyandry) (Ref. 49562).  Also Ref. 205.	NA

Both sexes do not spawn yearly and spawning intervals may vary according to area. In the St. Lawrence River, males spawn every 1-5 years, females every 3-5 years (Ref. 89103). Adults from the sea begin to ascend the lower reaches of large rivers in spring with the majority ascending immediately prior to spawning. Spawning occurs between March and August (Ref. 59043), when water temperature is 13.3-17.8 °C (Ref. 89118). Spawning occurs over bedrock, boulders or gravel bottoms, in depths exceeding 10 m at current velocities of 0.5-0.8 m/s (Ref. 59043, 89103). Exact time of spawning depends on temperature (Ref. 26938). Per female 0.4-8 million eggs may be spawned (Ref. 45706, 84845, 89137). Eggs demersal, sticking to stones, measuring 2.55 mm in diameter and hatching in 1 week at 17.8 °C (Ref. 4639, 9980). Adults return to the sea after spawning (Ref. 59043). Sturgeons in general have a high capacity for hybridization and most species are able to cross-breed (Ref. 89103, 89117). 	NA

This may be repeated several times before the eggs are covered by the female who swims along the edge of the of the redd, sweeping small pebbles and other particles into it with her tail and anal fin. Later, she may dig again and further cover the eggs while preparing a new nest (Ref. 27547).

Early upstream movement may be associated with feeding, but movement soon becomes a definite migration to the spawning area. Spawning begins at dusk, and continuing well into the night. A female  accompanied by a male, swims to the surface near the upstream end of the spawning ground. She rapidly moves across the current, extruding her eggs. The male, stays below the female so that as the eggs sink, sperm released, fertilizes the eggs. After completing a spawning pass, the female drifts downstream. She may repeat the spawning act over the downstream portion of the spawning area or may move upstream to the head of the grounds before releasing more eggs. Following spawning, there is a fairly rapid downstream migration to wintering grounds (Ref. 27547). It is not certain if spawning occurs annually or at longer intervals (Ref. 27547). Russian fish appear to spawn only every third or fourth year (Ref. 28219). Spawning frequency at Selawik, Alaska may be every other year (Ref. 27547).	NA

At spawning, the male follows a female, courting her with displays of his dorsal fin. He then drifts over beside her and curves his extended dorsal fin over the female. The pair vibrates and release eggs and milt. No redd is constructed, but the vibrations of the tails during the spawning act stirs up the substrate and produce a slight depression (Ref. 28876, 28879, 28880, 28881, 28882). A female may spawn only once, or several times in different areas (Ref. 1998). After spawning, adults establish summer territories in pools generally farther upstream from the spawning site, majority moving downstream in mid-September (Ref. 28885, 28886).	NA

Spawn on rock and gravel. Larvae benthic (Ref. 7471). According to a study (Ref. 10280), although no nest is built, a territory is established and one parent guards the nest. In Manitoba, females lay 200-1200 transparent eggs hatching in 7-10 days at 15.6°C. Young are pelagic and inhabit quiet waters inshore; pelagic stage lasts 4 months before typical bottom dwelling existence of adults commence (Ref 1998).

The female develops a conduit ovipositor by which it deposits its ovules between the gills of the bivalve. The male then comes to deposit its seed close to the respiratory opening of the bivalve; at the interior of which fertilization takes place. The male keeps the eggs and alevins until they leave the refuge. In exchange, the fish rids the bivalve of its parasites (Ref. 30578). The young leave the mussel about 28 days after hatching, having reached a length of about 10 mm (Ref. 41678).	NA

At spawning, males lie close to the bottom in the current of the spawning area while females stay along the banks and in still water (Ref. 27547). A female moves from the bank of the stream usually escorted by 2-4 males to the spawning area at the center of the stream. The males crowd beside her; egg deposition occurs as the males try to clasp the female with their pelvic fins or vibrate against her with their anal fins. This spawning act lasts for 3-5 seconds and may occur as often as 6-40 times per hour. After the eggs are deposited, the sexes separate and return to their previous stream positions (Ref.1998). Fish that moved out of a lake to spawn generally return to the lake a few days after spawning. However, river-resident fish may stay on or near the spawning area for much of the summer (Ref. 27547). Many spawn in two or even three consecutive years but others may skip one or two years between spawning (Ref. 10928).	NA

The pair swims side to side either head to head or head to tail. Their bodies flex as they swim making their caudal areas stroke each other. The male then makes slow undulating side to side movement interrupted by short, quick twitches signalling deposition of the eggs. Fertilization probably occurred between the time of release of eggs and the depositions. Deposition of an entire clutch of eggs takes from about 20 30 minutes in 3 minute intervals (Ref. 51567).	NA

The male builds the nest with plant fragments and binds it together with a kidney secretion. The nest has two openings. The male then entices the female into the nest with quick dancing movements. An enticed female follows the male to his nest, enters it through one opening, deposits 50 to 80 eggs, then leaves through the other opening (Ref. 1998, 27547). In nests with one opening, the female enters, turns around, deposits her eggs and leaves (Ref. 27547). The male then enters the nest and fertilizes the eggs as it swims toward  the other opening. More than one female may deposit eggs to the nest. The male guards one opening and aerates the eggs (Ref. 1998). Soon after releasing a clutch of eggs, a female feeds voraciously and in a day or so, is ready to be courted again (Ref. 27547). Sometimes the nest falls apart before the eggs hatch. The male may build a new nest nearby and transfer the eggs to it. At hatching, the male enters the nest to remove egg remains. Newly hatched larvae move to the top of the nest and settle on it. The male may construct a nursery above the nest. As the larvae become more active, the male catches them in his mouth and spits them back to the nest or nursery. As the larvae become more active, the male loses interest in them, and may build a new nest and repeat the process or the breeding season ends (Ref. 28993).  Eggs hatch in 6-7 days (Ref. 59043).	NA

Nest building usually occurs within 150 yards of where his nest was built  in previous years. The pair swims about the nest, rubbing and nipping each other and eventually come to rest on the bottom. Actual spawning occurs and lasts for 5 seconds. The pair then encircles the nest for about 25-45 seconds, before settling to spawn again. This goes on for 2 hours. After spawning, the female leaves the nest and may spawn with another male in another nest. Males guard the eggs and young. (Ref. 1998).	NA

The following account of mating behaviour comes from (Ref. 36980): 'In a typical behavior pattern, 5-10 males were observed following a gravid female..Once the female had selected a suitable spawning site, she would dig head first into the gravel with violent thrashing movements. After two or three attempts, females usually became half buried in the gravel with only head and pectoral fins exposed. During this activity attending males began making rapid darting movements around the female. The attending males moved closer to the buried female until one male, usually the largest, positioned himself beside or over her. Occasionally an even larger male would enter an area and replace the attendant male. After a male had remained with a buried female for a few minutes, he began to aggressively defend a territory. Other males that came within about 20 cm of the female were quickly chased away. In the absence of other males, the attendant male began courtship behavior by darting rapidly around the female, nudging her with his snout and perching along side or on top of her. Courtship lasted up to 30 min. Then the female began a series of rapid quivering movements followed by, or concurrent with, trembling movements by the male. It was assumed that the rapid vibrating movements of the female and male, lasting about 5 sec., indicated deposition of eggs and release of sperm. A female remained buried in the same spot during a series of 3-5 quiverings over a period of nearly 5 min. About 10 min after spawning, both fish moved away from the nest and egg guarding was not observed by either sex.'  Eggs are buried under small gravel and pebbles (Ref. 36980).	NA

The group then ascends to shallow water, females roll on their side, and eggs and sperm are released. Deposition of eggs usually occurs in a single night (Ref. 1998). Larvae pelagic (Ref. 7471).	NA

Mating is preceded by courtship. The male moves slowly toward the female, who retreats. Her flight stimulates pursuit by up to 10 males. During the pursuit, males attempt to bring their anal regions in contact with that of the female. One male heads off the female, urging her away from the group of males and also driving them away. The female is conducted to the shelter of a rock or other object, where the courtship dance begins. In this dance, the male, with dorsal fin fully erect, swims by means of his pectoral fin in a figure eight pattern over the female, udulating in both the horizontal and vertical planes. The male then stops, faces the female head to head, quivers, then moves his jaws and undulates his dorsal fin. He then moves beside the female, facing in the same direction, and repeats the movements. Finally, the male tilts on his side, the female tilts slightly away from hin, and the anal regions are brought in contact with each other. Copulation lasts less than a second. Gestation takes five to six months. Bears 3 to 36 young.  Female carries the developing young (Ref. 205).  Males are mature and ripe at birth. Juvenile females are mated soon after being born (Ref. 27547).	NA

Mating begins with three stages of courtship: 1) attraction and identification of prospective mate; 2) arousal and appeasement by nudging (the female initiates this move); 3) synchrony occurs when the female starts to rub the rocky wall in the spawning territory, quivering her body against the rock, shaking her anal fin and keeping her dorsal fin erect, the male meanwhile remained perpendicular, biting the sides of the female's body, dorsal fin and upper side of head, and sometimes rubbing her body laterally with his tail. Release of eggs and sperm follows as the male and female bodies quiver.  Nest fanning by the male parent comes after  this range of display.  Driven out by the male, the female moves away from the spawning area while the male continues to patrol the nest, swimming in circular direction and defending the area against other fish.  Each cycle lasts for 65.3 seconds, becoming shorter in duration when there are two females involved in the mating event.  One cycle is followed by another after the male has returned from patrolling the nest (Ref. 55747).	NA

Pairs will spawn routinely in aquaria in the absence of the sponges (Ref. 205).
According to aquarium observations by Breder (1941), ""spawning takes place with the female in an inverted position while the male remains upright, wandering females adding to the eggs.  The nesting male on sexual exhaustion repulses additional females with a typical warning attitude and eventual biting similar to its reaction to another male or other fish."""	NA

The following account of mating behaviour comes from Ragland et.al. (1978): observed from an aquarium, courtship began 'when a gravid female approached a shelter occupied by a male. The male, which was not guarding eggs, responded by rolling its head in a circle and flaring the orange branchiostegal membranes. The cirri were not moved or deployed in any obvious fashion.
The female either ignored the male or responded by snapping the head horizontally several times in rapid succession and occasionally quivering. Once she entered the nest, the male often extruded its pene and performed bouts of a fanning display similar to those of other cottids (Ref. 205). The female left the nest shortly after laying eggs.'
Occurrence of intromission was not observed from this study due to technical problems. However, eggs stripped from gravid females developed and hatched after 11-15 days in the absence of a male, thereby supporting the hypothesis that internal fertilization had occurred."	NA

They move downstream to estuaries or at least to lower reaches of rivers in the spring, mostly at night (Ref. 27547). Eggs are deposited on the undersurface of a rock, in adhesive masses (Ref. 1998). Over 7,000 eggs have been found in a single nest, suggesting that a male may spawn with several females (Ref. 1998, 27547). The male guards the nest until all eggs have hatched (Ref. 1998, 27547). A reverse, upstream migration of yearlings and adults occur in late summer to early winter, from August to December (Ref. 27547).	NA

Females aggregate some distance upstream and move down singly to the spawning area. Courtship behavior occurs outside the nest until a  female is selected. The pair enter the nesting site, courting continues until eggs are deposited and fertilized. The female then leaves the nest and goes back upstream to feed, while the male spawns with other females or fans and guards the eggs. The male does not feed until the eggs have hatched, moving upstream only in the late summer (Ref. 1998, 27547). During the planktonic stage, larvae of the freshwater nonanadromous form in lakes show distinct diurnal vertical migrations, being most abundant at the surface during the darkest hours of the night. They apparently stay deep in the water during the day and on bright moonlight nights (Ref. 28920). Metamorphosis is complete by the end of the planktonic period and the young take up a demersal mode of life. The young coastal form may move upstream during the fall, although the young may remain in the estuary for a full year (Ref. 27547).	NA

Spawning males are territorial toward other males (Ref. 27547). He attracts a female into the nesting site and after more courting the female deposits her adhesive eggs. The female is then driven out and the male guards the eggs until hatching occurs. The nest usually contains eggs from several females (Ref. 27547). The male has also been observed to guard the young (Ref. 1998).	NA

Two or three days prior to spawning, the females become restless and swim about between short periods of rest. When a female swims over a male, he undulates his body from side to side and raises his spiny dorsal fin, If the female comes to rest near the male, he moves close to her in a series of short darts. Both then fan rhythymically with their pectoral fins, making a hole. The pair lie side by side, with the male's caudal fin twisted under that of the female. The male make rhythmic motions toward the female with his tail, and the motions apparently stimulate her to release her eggs (Ref. 28900, 28901). After spawning the female leaves the nest; the eggs are fanned and guarded by the male until hatching which occurs in the spring (Ref. 27547).	NA

During the early stages of its spawning migration, the river lamprey has been shown to be attracted to chemical odours given off by ammocoetes (Ref. 88188). Males reach the spawning grounds first and build nests at depths between 50-100 cm, which have a diameter of 20-40 cm and a height of 10 cm (Ref. 12285, 51442, 59043, 88186). The river lamprey forms spawning aggregations, often during sunny days, when water temperature rises above 9 °C (Ref. 59043). Females may spawn with up to 6 males on separate occasions. One nest is usually utilized by a single mating pair (Ref. 59043). Adults spawn only once in their lifetime and usually die within 2 weeks after spawning (Ref. 12285, 51442). Eggs hatch in 15-30 days (Ref. 88184). The ammocoetes live in the calm zones of the river until metamorphosis at about 13 cm length before migrating to the sea (Ref. 51442).	NA

Embryos feed solely on yolk (Ref. 50449).  6 to 52 young in a litter (Ref. 26346). Litter size increases with the size of the mother. Embryos reach 30-36 cm TL at birth (Ref. 6080). In the southern waters of Australia, newly born and older juveniles (30-70 cm long) aggregate in 'nursery areas' found in shallow waters.They move to deeper coastal waters to over-winter. The following spring finds most of these young returning to their nursery areas. The older ones, aged 2 years and over move instead to eastern Bass Strait where most of the immature stock are found. The length of an average full-term embryo is 32 cm. Spawning frequency is once every year, ovulation occurring in early summer and parturition is completed by January of the following year. Gestation period lasts for about 12 months (Ref. 6390, 6871).	NA

Spawning happens in the summer and generally every two years. Membranes on eggs become increasingly more sticky after fertilization and this allows them to stick to the substratum. This can become a problem in nurseries, but it is solved by washing the eggs in clay or diatomaceous earth suspensions. Caviar (not fecundated ovocites ) can be over 1 0% of the corporal weight of a mature female. Incubation

Breeding sites may be found in rivers, lakes, ponds or swamps (Ref. 205).  Breeding individuals are recorded at all depths, but the species appears to prefer shallow water (<50m) (Ref. 4916, 27004, 52142).  It comes inshore to breed, a nest being made in shallow water on a sandy substrate (Ref. 4364).  Nest are build by males, with a circular or oval shape, about 3 feet in diameter, the centre below the surface level (Ref. 4916).  Reputed to breed among the rocks (Ref. 2781, 52146), with nest often build so that rocks provide extra cover (Ref. 4916).  Small fish are being guarded in their nests (Ref. 52142).  The female exhibits parental care of her brood of young, in co-operation with nest-guarding territorial cichlids (Ref. 27004).  In other studies, parental care is exhibited by both male and female (Ref. 52178, 52179).  Brood-mixing occurs when cichlid parents 'farm out' their young into broods of the catfish and in half the cases, the cichlid parents remain near by and assist in brood defence (Ref. 52143).  Juveniles mainly feed on trophic eggs released by the female (Ref. 36945), whilst the male helps the young in searching for invertebrates in and around the nest (Ref. 36945).  Mutualistic relationship with cichlids concerning defence and feeding of the young of both the cichlids and <i>B. meridionalis</i> (Ref. 52146).  If the female, after laying the eggs, leaves the nest in charge of the male (which is generally smaller than the female) and goes back to deep water, this might account for the disparity in sex ratio observed between shallow and deep waters (Ref. 4364, 4916).

Courtship behavior: a male approaches 1 or more females from behind, changing color from dark brown to brownish white while the edges of median fins remained dark. As the male gets near, it flicks its dorsal and pelvic fins eliciting a mild lateral display from the female. The male rolls onto its side and shakes from side to side as its abdomen passes the female. Takes 15 seconds (Ref. 2160)."	NA

After a while the male stays very close to the female and at times the female will remain motionless in the water and the male will come up to her from behind and nudge her with sidewise movements of his head. The enlarged and swollen anal fin of the male is folded in a cup-like fashion and is used to brush the female (Ref. 42791). No nest is constructed, but the eggs are laid a few at a time throughout the thick vegetation (Ref. 42791). The larvae, which move about with the male parent in a dense school, are provided with accessory gills and appear very salamander-like (Ref. 42791).	NA

Eggs are laid in nests through elaborate tunnels in vegetated areas which look like vertical columns of water with the eggs floating in the center (Ref. 205). The male and female move towards the center of the nest during spawning where the male entwines his body to the female moving upward while releasing the eggs to be fertilised (Ref. 45309). Eggs are guarded by one or both parents. Hatching takes place in a day (Ref. 6028).	NA

Enter estuaries and ascend rivers in May and June when water temperature is between 10-14 °C (Refs. 188, 51442, 59043, 89636). Males begin such movements at 2-3 years, females at 3-4 years (Ref. 59043). Although movement upstream is usually limited to a few kilometres above the brackish zone (Refs. 59043, 89486), spawning has also been reported in non-tidal freshwater areas up to 400 km upstream (Ref. 89637). Gametogenesis occurs in the estuaries. Early arrivals in the rivers are mostly males, with the sex ratio becoming more equal with the later arrivals (Ref. 42360). Spawning movements occur with spring tides and peak when river discharge levels are high (Refs. 89636, 89638). However, when flows are too high, movements upstream become limited (Refs. 89636, 89639). Spawn when water temperature is anywhere between 12-22 °C (Ref. 10541). Move to riverine spawning grounds at night; spawn in large, very noisy schools near surface and leave these areas before daybreak (Ref. 10541). 
Spawning sites consist of sand and gravel areas with flowing water (Ref. 10541). Spent adults return to the sea and may spawn for 3-4 seasons throughout their lifetime (Refs. 30578, 51442, 59043). Most individuals will have lost 22 % of their body weight after spawning (Ref. 89640). There is some evidence that most individuals return to their natal rivers to spawn (Refs. 10541, 59043). Eggs either drift with the current or sink to the bottom (Ref. 59043, 89641). Eggs hatch after 2-8 days, depending on water temperature (optimal 15-25 °C) (Refs. 35387, 41851). Larvae and juveniles move towards the estuaries and river mouths during their first summer and to the sea at the end of their second year (Ref. 59043). Males mature mainly between the ages of 2-5 years, females between 3-7 years (Ref. 188, 2163, 10541). Length at maturity is between 30-40 cm total length (Ref. 88187).

The nest is a relatively large depression with the shape of a flat dish and proportions relative to the size of the fish (Ref. 51638). A single well formed hole of about 10-15cm in diameter and 10-15cm depth is present nearly in the middle (Ref. 51638). Eggs are laid inside this hole (Ref. 51638).  Eggs are white, having a diameter of little more than 1 millimeter (Ref. 45962).  Larvae stay in the hole a couple of days after hatching (Ref. 51638).

Females migrate to spawning sites, larger females travel long distances to downcurrent areas than smaller ones to protect the eggs from becoming prey to larger reef fishes (Ref. 32198). Spawning sites are chosen by the females irregardless of the males occupying them (Ref. 32198). Females spawn in more than one spawning site, each site occupied by more than one male, which are either territorial or non-territorial (Ref. 32198). After spawning, they return individually to their home ranges without passing through other spawning sites (Ref. 32198). Some females on the other hand change sex after spawning (Ref. 32198). As males, they begin to establish territories in the spawning sites, even to those they visited before the sex change (Ref. 32198). This observation support the suggestion (Warner's 1985, 1986) that females stored information on spawning sites by migrating to various sites which aided in the acquisition of a mating territory after changing sex (Ref. 32198).

Although males did not show features of parental care such as fanning or egg-cleaning in an aquarium condition, they continued to tend the shelter and attack other fish introduced to the aquarium.
Once a ripe female was introduced to a male aquarium, the male starts to pursue the female, nudging its belly. The female is then led to or visited voluntarily the male shelter. Subsequently, either in the shelter (usually) or outside, the male wraps its body around the head and abdomen of the female, with the female's head against the male's caudal peduncle. The pair remain in this position for 5.2-9.2 seconds (6.1-7.8 seconds on the average for each pair). The female, firmly held by the male's pectoral, pelvic, anal and caudal fins, slowly beats its caudal fin during the embrace. The embrace is terminated by spawning, with the female often turning its abdomen upwards when releasing eggs. Neither conspicuous ejaculatory behavior by the male nor turbidity caused by the semen was observed. Immediately after spawning, the female stirs the eggs by quickly swinging its body, leaves the spawning site afterwards or is chased away by the male.
After several minutes, the female either returns voluntarily or is led back by the male to the shelter, repeating the same behavioral pattern all over again. The mean interval between successive spawnings ranged from 1.7-7.0 mins.
It was also observed that immediately following spawning, all males were observed to forage for eggs."	NA

About one to two weeks before spawning takes place, the fish swim side by side with their bodies touching. Eventually, the female releases a cluster of orange-red eggs.

Distinct pairing with embrace (Ref. 205). During courtship, the male will hold onto the pectoral margin of a female  (sometimes for hours) as she swims through the water. The male flips under the female and inserts a clasper. The male beats his tail from side to side to move the clasper backward and forward in the cloca. Copulation lasts 3-5 minutes. Males have been observed to nudge the female's abdomen during parturition. Viviparous, young born at about 36 cm WD (Ref. 6871).	NA

Social and mating systems of this species are based upon female territoriality where polygyny results from males defending females occupying a certain territory (female-defense polygyny) (Ref. 55082).  All sexually mature females are territorial females (Ref. 55082).  Neither parent guards the eggs which are laid in a nest located in the female's territory (Ref. 46142).
During breeding, territorial females perform the 'caudal flexing with swollen abdomen display' to signal courtship and readiness to spawn. The male acknowledges with no courtship or color displays but rather by visiting the sites frequently. The territorial female then begins pecking at the substrate in preparation for egg laying. The female initiates the spawning event by pressing her abdomen into the prepared site. The territorial male quickly lays his body across her caudal peduncle and both remained in this position for 5-10 sec. The male swims away after leaving the female beating her anal fin rapidly over the nest site to ensure fertilization of the eggs and to push the eggs deep into the algal substrate (Ref. 46142). All territorial males spawn with territorial females, depriving the bachelor males of the chance to copulate which nevertheless don't interfere with the spawning between the territorial male and females (Ref. 46142)."

Spawning commences when after swimming together in different tufts, the female concentrates on just one and begins to thrust repeatedly and pause. The male follows suit nuzzling the female. The female then drops into the algae and spawns, while the male releases the sperm beside her. The pair then swims back to their territory (Ref. 46144). Monogamous mating is observed as both facultative and social (Ref. 52884).	NA

Details of reproductive behaviour from Katano, et al (1988): "" A male first energeticaly pursued a female with its head near to the female's belly (chasing) and then began to cling to the female's body from the side, bending its tail or head (clinging). Finally the male enfolded the female's body, with its anus near to the female's (enfolding). In some cases, 2-4 males pursued a single female and two males enfolded a female at the same time. Although no aggressive behaviour was evident between males, it was always the largest male that could almost frequently approach and enfold the female. The mating pair moved a long distance in a ditch, paddy field and/or creek, performing reproductive activities.""

The gonads of hagfishes are situated in the peritoneal cavity. The ovary is found in the anterior portion of the gonad, and the testis is found in the posterior part. The animal becomes female if the cranial part of the gonad develops or male if the caudal part undergoes differentiation. If none develops, then the animal becomes sterile. If both anterior and posterior parts develop, then the animal becomes a functional hermaphrodite. However, hermaphroditism being characterised as functional needs to be validated by more reproduction studies (Ref. 51361 ).	NA

Although a few pairs changed partners, most pairs remained together over successive rounds of spawnings according to a study (Ref. 84980). Spawning cycle is semilunar. Males construct burrows where the eggs are deposited. Only the males guard the burrows, occassionaly fanning the eggs to provide oxygenated sea water to the burrow.  They do this about 41% of the time at the expense of feeding.  Egg guarding lasts for 3-4 days after which the eggs hatch in time for the full or new moon phases (Ref. 84980).  Parental care shifted from male to female in a study where the male parent was removed from the burrow which according to the study could be attributed to the spatial closeness of the parents and no requirement of special structures for guarding the offsprings (Ref. ).

The mound promotes water-exchange in the burrow which helps the male in tending the eggs (Ref. 85149). The amount of female parental investment is displayed by the height of the constructed mound (Ref. 85149). Consequently, larger females build higher mounds which affects male mating preference (Ref. 85149). Monogamous mating is observed as both obligate and social (Ref. 52884).	NA

Sexes can be readily distinguished by the male's intromittent organ and the female's genital pore (Ref. 240, 205). On the basis of this morphology, copulation may involve flexion of the male's body and pumping of sperm into the female (Ref. 240). Embryos are retained in the ovaries until about 6 mm long, deriving nourishment from large yolk sacs, making the species ovoviviparous rather than viviparous (Ref. 240).	NA

For several days prior to the estimated egg-laying time, the pairs were in continuous close company, swimming near the surface. Courting activities include close following, intermittent angled swimming (head down), vent nudging and lifting by the male. Individual males are capable of participating in at least two spawnings per season. A male will repair with a new available female within several weeks of an initial mating.
Females carrying unhatched eggs or larvae in the mouth are distinguished by a conspicuous white chin during the incubation period. Incubating females spend more time at the surface, exhibit no aggression to other non-carrying individuals and show no interest in food. Occasionally two incubating females will briefly act aggressively towards each other. During the latter stages of incubation the females concerned continually circle and inspect shallow shore areas.
Temporary release and recall of developing larvae occurs during daylight hours. The female comes into the littoral shallows, releases the full brood and continues swimming slowly parallel to the bank. Larvae maintain station around the head of the adult with individuals making brief excursions to the pond edge. The released juveniles are observed closely by the female. A sudden kinking movement of her body is followed by the rapid return of young to her mouth"" (Ref. 39857)."	NA

The male stirs up the female with his barbels on her head and back; the female collects sperm in its mouth; lays down about 20 eggs (yellow in color, 1 mm in size) which she collects with her pelvic fins, then fertilizes them and fixes them to submerged rocks or plants. Such sequence takes place for 2-3 hours, thus resulting in spawning of 100-200 eggs. Several spawnings are possible in the same season. At 22°C, hatching occurs after 5 days, the vitellin being absorbed 3 days later (Ref. 35381)."	NA

The gonads of hagfishes are situated in the peritoneal cavity. The ovary is found in the anterior portion of the gonad, and the testis is found in the posterior part. The animal becomes female if the cranial part of the gonad develops or male if the caudal part undergoes differentiation. If none develops, then the animal becomes sterile. If both anterior and posterior parts develop, then the animal becomes a functional hermaphrodite. However, hermaphroditism being characterised as functional needs to be validated by more reproduction studies (Ref. 51361 ).	NA

Immediately the female stops, the male first places his head under that of the female and then, by bending his body towards her anal fin, positions himself such that his tail is towards the end of the female's snout. From this position, the male then begins to wrap his tail around the head of the female, gradually winding his body tighter and moving along the body of the female until positioned at the center of her body. The male then winds his body tightly around the dorsal side of the female's abdomen for 20-30 seconds. The female then shakes her head from side to side several times, and orientates her body downward. This behavior causes the male to become separated from the female. Immediately after separation, the female releases a large number of eggs, and circles around with the male following on the inside. Although gamete release by the male was not actually observed, it seems likely that the eggs are fertilized during circling. After circling, the pair turns round twice violently, causing the eggs to become widely scattered. The pair then swim away with the female in the lead.	NA

They attach themselves to stones before mating. Females die immediately after releasing their eggs, but males survive until spermatogenesis ceases and can mate with more than one female (Ref. 12275).  Ammocoete stage lasts 2-4 years in freshwater after which metamorphosed juveniles migrate to the sea (Ref. 59043).  In lower Volga, adults may feed one or two summers before breeding (Ref. 59043).  These adults may begin to migrate to rivers in autumn and winter, usually from October to February, unstopped by ice flow in Volga (Ref. 59043).	NA

The gonads of hagfishes are situated in the peritoneal cavity. The ovary is found in the anterior portion of the gonad, and the testis is found in the posterior part. The animal becomes female if the cranial part of the gonad develops or male if the caudal part undergoes differentiation. If none develops, then the animal becomes sterile. If both anterior and posterior parts develop, then the animal becomes a functional hermaphrodite. However, hermaphroditism being characterised as functional needs to be validated by more reproduction studies (Ref. 51361 ).	NA

Female collects eggs up into her mouth before they sink to the bottom and then moves to the genital area of the male. There the sperm are shed and taken into the mouth of the female where fertilization takes place. Eggs hatch after about 4 weeks of incubation (Ref. 7020). Produces 5-17 eggs (Ref. 1672).  In one study, eggs from the cleavage phase and larvae of up to 1.45 cm TL are mouthbrooded by female parents ranging from 6.2 to 7.9 cm SL long (Ref. 86760).	NA

The eggs are spread into a flat mass as the fish holds fast to the under surface of a stone. The eggs are fastened to the stones by the gelatinous threads that cover them (Ref. 110258).  The male ejects his milt on the mass of eggs (Ref. 110258).
Spawning occurs in freshwater afterwhich eggs and larvae are washed down by the river current into the sea and goes back up the river after a month or so (Ref. 110258). The embryo development occurs in freshwater and the larvae should migrate to saltwater a few days following hatching. The larvae are carried by current to the sea where they grow up to the juvenile stage (""bichique""). At this stage the alevins get to the rivers and start going upstream during the new moon. They can go up to waterfalls higher than 10 meters with the help of their sucker-disc, that they can colonize waters up to 800m altitude (Ref. 48660)."	NA

The spawning act occurs at night or during the day. A female begins to swim vertically toward the surface, belly upstream. A male (sometimes 2 or 3) joins her and eggs and milt are released as fish approach the surface. The fish break the surface, fall away from each other and return to the bottom. After spawning most move downstream. The young of the year move downstream during their first year and do not return until they are sexually mature. Generally, the same spawning grounds are utilized yearly (Ref. 27547).	NA

If both anterior and posterior parts develop, then the animal becomes a functional hermaphrodite. However, hermaphroditism being characterised as functional needs to be validated by more reproduction studies (Ref. 51361 ).	NA

Sexually segregated schools (uniform size & age-bet. 4-10 y) migrate upstream: female groups some days or weeks in advance. Most abundant in lakes fed by suitable shallow streams with rock or gravel substrates. Male nudges female vent region; eggs released, fertilized. Eggs turn transparent, increase to 4.0 mm diameter, are spherical, adhesive and demersal and are swept downstream lodging in boulders and pebbles. Hatching in 10-18 days (11-18°C). Larvae shelter in boulders.	NA

Male then pushes an open pocket (formed using his anal fin) below the genital opening of the female; female releases eggs into the pocket and male fertilizes them and allows them to drop into a small pit in the sand that he has previously made. Male fans the eggs with his fins until hatching, in about 24 hours, and continues to guard the fry until they are free-swimming (Ref. 7020).	NA

Male in water splashes the clutch periodically (Ref. 7471). In the aquarium, male and female swim vertically to the surface, flick their tails and leap up to a leaf. Female lays from 5 to 8 eggs on the leaf and male fertilizes them immediately. This procedure is repeated several times until some hundreds of eggs have been laid. Male then keeps the eggs damp by flicking his tail to spray them with water. As eggs hatch, fry fall into the water (Ref. 7020).	NA

After the nuptial embrace, the female picks up the fertilized egg from the male's curved body, proceeds to transfer the eggs to the male for oral brooding by spitting out the eggs and the male gulps the eggs into its buccal sac. Male sometimes rejects the eggs, but the female continues spitting and gulping the eggs until the male finally accepts. This process continues until all the fertilized eggs have been transferred, then another bout of egg laying occurs with the whole procedure repeated.	NA

Movement into the streams begins when water temperatures reach 2° to 4°C or higher. The upstream run is generally short, at most a few km (Ref. 11226, 28996). Movement to spawning grounds are usually made at night. Males reach spawning grounds an hour or so before the females. Spawning is initiated, at least in part, by the presence of the proper sex ratio in the group, which has been indicated to be no more than four males to one female (Ref. 30366, 30374). The spawning group crowd together and move upstream. Body contact between a male and female brings about a release of sperm and eggs. Only a few eggs are extruded at each spawning act (Ref. 30366), so that the act is repeated over several hours each night for several nights until all eggs are extruded. After each evening's activities, most drift downstream to the larger body of water whence they came to the spawning grounds. Some, mostly males, may remain in the spawning stream during the day. Many spawned-out fish, especially males, die after spawning, but those that survive will spawn again the following year (Ref. 27547). Lake shore spawners on the other hand move inshore in small schools and swim about over rather restricted areas, apparently without any distinct pairing. The composition of the schools change constantly, for individual fish apparently engage in spawning activities for only 15 to 30 minutes at a time, then leave the school (Ref. 30374, 30376).	NA

Do not obviously pair, as other seahorses do (Ref. 30915). Fertilised eggs deposited by females in the pouch of males are incubated for about four weeks before hatching (Ref. 31838). Hatching occurs at night, coinciding with full moon periods during summer months (Ref. 31838). Young emerge from the pouch and immediately rise to the surface where they grasp floating debris with their tail (Ref. 31838).	NA

Males defend territories of usually less than a square meter surface around a larger crevice. During courtship and male-male interactions they leave the crevice, but usually do not  move far away from it. Females are led to the crevice, where the spawning takes place. Males are vigorously defending the territories against conspecific males. Brooding females guard small territories around a small cave at variable water depths. In the aquarium, females release their fry after about 21 days but continue to keep them in the mouth in situations of danger and at night, for up to another 21 days.	NA

The gonads of hagfishes are situated in the peritoneal cavity. The ovary is found in the anterior portion of the gonad, and the testis is found in the posterior part. The animal becomes female if the cranial part of the gonad develops or male if the caudal part undergoes differentiation. If none develops, then the animal becomes sterile. If both anterior and posterior parts develop, then the animal becomes a functional hermaphrodite.

From variable colonies in a reef, each eel occupies a burrow it has dug, reaching into the water column to pick out the plankton for food. Prior to spawning, the male and female move their burrows close together; whether the male or the female moves is not known. The male then defends the female from other males, and prolonged and vigorous inter-male combat is common.
On the day of spawning, the male extends out of his burrow toward the female. Both spread their dorsdal fins broadly and the male rubs his head over the female's body. If not ready, the female withdraws into her burrow; if ready, she extends toward the male and wraps her body once or twice around his, bringing her urogenital opening close to his. The pair remains in this position until spawning occurs, which may take up to nine hours or more."	NA

The gonads of hagfishes are situated in the peritoneal cavity. The ovary is found in the anterior portion of the gonad, and the testis is found in the posterior part. The animal becomes female if the cranial part of the gonad develops or male if the caudal part undergoes differentiation. If none develops, then the animal becomes sterile. If both anterior and posterior parts develop, then the animal becomes a functional hermaphrodite. However, hermaphroditism being characterised as functional needs to be validated by more reproduction studies (Ref. 51361 ).	NA

Males display an elaborate courtship behavior beginning  with waving lateral movement in front of female, with the unpaired fins completely opened. In an oblique position, the male touches the bottom surface with the anterior portion of its head, with vibrating body. The female placed her body side to side with the male. Then both couple dives into the substrates where spawning takes place (Ref. 42934).	NA

Eggs are guarded by both sexes, but more intensively by the female. Hatching occurs after three days post-spawn.
Larvae are normally deposited on the bottom of the cave, rarely in other caves nearby the original cave. Juveniles are free swimming 8 or 9 days post-hatching, and are guarded by both parents for about 5 to 6 weeks. Breeding and guarding individuals of both sexes regularly exhibit more aggressive and intensive coloration. The dark, longitudinal stripe that is typical for breeding and guarding specimens of both sexes in
many other cave breeders of the chromidotilapiine lineage (e.g., <i>Pelvicachromis</i>, <i>Congochromis</i>, and <i>Parananochromis</i>) is prominently visible in males, but is more rarely and weakly visible in females. In this
character, females of Enigmatochromis differ from females of <i>Pelvicachromis</i>, <i>Congochromis</i> and <i>Parananochromis</i>, where a prominent dark, longitudinal stripe is typical for females (and only rarely for males) during the first 2 to 4 weeks when guarding fry (Ref. 81928)."	NA
